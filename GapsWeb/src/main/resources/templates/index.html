    <p class="text-muted">Gaps searches through your Plex Server. It then queries
        for known
        movies in the same
        collection using The MovieDB, which you will need to get. Don't worry, we'll walk you through
        those
        steps. Anyway, if those movies don't exist in your library, Gaps will recommend getting those
        movies, legally of course.</p>

    <p class="text-muted">An example would be having a copy of 'Alien (1979)' and Gaps
        recommending
        'Aliens (1986)' and
        'AlienÂ³ (1992)' to be added to your collection.</p>

    <h4 class="top-margin text-primary">Getting Started</h4>
    <p class="text-muted">To get started, head to <a th:href="@{/configuration}">configuration</a> and enter your TMDB ID and
        Plex Server
        information.</p>
